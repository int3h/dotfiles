# Hack to symlink files in home/ that *don't* start with a '.'. Since a glob generally only allows
# you to select with or without a dot, but not both; and beacuse two '~/' keys in a dict will
# conflict, putting a second `link` command down here with its own `~/` entry works.

# TODO:
#   - Add Janus as a submodule
#       - Find way to manually bump the version (commit) of tlib submodule, to fix bug
#       - Maybe: experiment with bumping version of all submodules to HEAD of `main`
#   - Run command to hide ~/bin
#   - Maybe: auto-run homebrew with .Brewfile
#       - Might want to not link .Brewfile to ~/
#   - Maybe: automatically compile YouCompleteMe & update other Vim plugins
