# TODO:
#   - Add Janus as a submodule
#       - Find way to manually bump the version (commit) of tlib submodule, to fix bug
#       - Maybe: experiment with bumping version of all submodules to HEAD of `main`
#   - Maybe: auto-run homebrew with .Brewfile
#       - Might want to not link .Brewfile to ~/
#   - Maybe: automatically compile YouCompleteMe & update other Vim plugins
